# Start Project

Click `index.html` to run this application. You will see the jasmine test page first, and the application's detail later.
If all the tests passed, you will see the test entries are all green.


## Additional library

I use another jasmine library called `jasmine-jquery` and implied in the path `jasmine/spec/..`


# Development Strategy
I remained todo annotation to make the project more readable.
